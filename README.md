# PdfInjection
School Project

To use this you'll need to download a js injection tool [here](https://github.com/cornerpirate/JS2PDFInjector). Credits to the creator of the tool.
Once downloaded you have to fill in the txt file with your code. Example app.launchUrl("http/example.url/1", true). [api details](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf), can also be accessed from the link above.
When you are done with the txt file all you need to do is run the tool and select any pdf you want to inject then the txt file and you are done.
